        // Answer any questions that are listed in the PE with a question mark:

        // 1. Why is Monster abstract?


        // 2. Briefly summarize:  What code does the Monster class have/is handling?  


        // 3. Briefly summarize:  What code do the two child classes have/are handling?  


        // 4. Why are those classes handling the code that they contain?
        // (In other words, why was the project architecture designed this way?)


        // 5. Why is the Random object a field of the Monster class and not a field of the child classes?
